This is the checkout page

Users will be able to view the items in their basket (which they have selected on the "Shop" page) and
pay for them.

There will be an option to update the basket:
    - Users can change the quantity of an item(s) in their basket.
    - They can also completely remove an item from their basket.

A "Complete Order" button will then prompt users to fill in their payment details after being clicked. The user can
then select their preferred method of payment (eg, Visa, Mastercard, PayPal, Apple Pay etc).
NOTE: If there are no items in the basket, the "Complete Order" button will not be clickable.

After filling in their details, a "Confirm Payment" button can be clicked which will validate the payment
data (making sure it is correct). If the payment details are invalid, an error message will prompt the user
to fill in the form correctly.

If the payment details are recognised however, the order will be processed and the user will be shown a
screen which lets them know their order has been successful.
